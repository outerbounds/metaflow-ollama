        This is the essential function every production Ollama user needs.

        max_retries is the important parameter here, which needs to play in sync with how the circuit breaker in @ollama resets the server.
        The key insight is to make this number big enough so this function doesn't give up retrying as the circuit breaker is resetting the server,
        then this request gets unnecessarily dropped when it could have just waited a bit more.
